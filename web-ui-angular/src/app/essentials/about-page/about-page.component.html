  <h2 class="title text-h2">About Posther</h2>

  <p>
    Posther is a proof of concept dApp deployed on Ethereum Kovan. It was
    created with two major goals in mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is an open source project to showcase some
    <strong>basics of blockchain development</strong> on all levels of the
    stack. You can check out the deployed contract on
    <a [href]="contractLink" target="_blank">Etherscan</a>. The complete source
    code is available on <a [href]="githubLink" target="_blank">Github</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It aims to enable the persistence of plain text on Ethereum with the
    <strong>lowest possible gas fees </strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Posted text is stored as calldata. No on-chain events are emitted, no EVM
    storage is used.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stored text can only be retrieved by scanning transactions related to
    the contract, but the contract state itself holds no such information.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to efficiently explore existing posts it would be necessary to
    index them. This requires special backend support. An improved version of
    this app, with such indexing capabilities, should ðŸ™‚ be available soon!
  </p>

  <p>
    Published posths can be accessed directly via their respective transaction
    hashes. A better UX would be to have shortlinks. Without special backend
    support or a more complex smart contract logic, the uniqueness of such short
    links could not be ensured. So this is nother feature for an improved
    Posther.
